This is my first creation for Defi

This project is part of the tutorial from Alchemy, which includes challenge in modifying codes in Javascript in OpenZappelin to make it workable.

Imagine having someone offering you some Eth for coffee, sending words or encouragement (or motivation :-)).

As I progress more, there will be more dynamic and interesting projects soon as I'm still consider myself new in the blockchain and development field.
